 QWEST	:  do i need to install smth else in addintion to IDE
 ANS	:  for Arduino IDE ver. 1.8.19 all additional components (JAVA, programmer driver) are in the same folder as IDE itself
		   for Arduino IDE ver. 2.0.0  all additional components ( ... ) are also installed with IDE, but couldn't be found in the folder

 QWEST	:  where are libraries 
 ANS	:  for Arduino IDE ver. 1.8.19 all standard libraries and folder for users are in the same foldar as IDE itself
		   for Arduino IDE ver. 2.0.0  all standard labraries and folder for users are in: 'Documents/Arduino/libraries' for both Windows and Linux

 QWEST  :  why does IDE always create folder for .ino sketch file (and folder must have the same name)
 ANS    :  it is inner IDE requirement, nothing special 

 QWEST  :  can I use another IDE?
 ANS    :  possible variants =
             a) Arduino extension for VSCode
		        - works only with Arduino IDE 1.x.x installed and use it's libraries
				- doesn't have serial port input so use IDE itself to communicate with board
			 b) PlatformIO extension for VSCode 
			    - works as independent IDE
				- debugging only for subsribers
				- serial port input gets only 1 char per time (no inner buffer)

 ERROR	:  stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding
 FIX	:  Arduino IDE - Tools - Processor - try '... old bootloader' menu point

 ERROR  :  grpc: error while marshaling: proto: Marshal called with nil
 FIX    :  be shure that controller version has been chosen before compiling

 ERROR  :  VSCode IntelliSence can't recognize built-in Arduino entities = "Attempt to include more than one <avr/ioXXX.h> file." appears if include header explicitely
 FIX    :  add "__AVR_ATmega328P__" (or another appropiate) definition to 'proect/.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json' + add "arduino.disableIntelliSenseAutoGen": true to Arduino extension settings
