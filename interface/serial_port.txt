  Serial aproach is replacement for parallel ones.
  Current usage:
    > communication channels (USB cable, Ethernet, ...)
	> computer buses (e.g. PCI was replaced by PCI Express, common motherboard interface = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express)

  Advantages:
	- channels low cost (only one is needed)
	- no problems with clock skew (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_skew)
	- no problems with interconnect density (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interconnect_(integrated_circuits)
  Difficulties:
  	- signal integrity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_integrity) << improved enough, not a problem
    - transmission speed is lower then in parallel interfaces << improved enough, not a problem
	- need serializer and deserializer (SerDes)

  Serial PORT is a name for any module which purpose is to establish serial communication
  Serial port components:
    HW (hardware layer) = is INTERFACE
	SW (software layer) = is PROTOCOL

  UART (universal asynchronous reciever-transmitter, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port, https://habr.com/ru/post/109395/)
	- the most widespread protocol is RS-232
	- naming notes:
	    serial port = abstraction, but is used to indicate UART sometimes (because of RS-232 popularity) 
		COM port = slang naming of RS-232, but is used as abstraction (because in Windows it indicates any serial devices now) 
    - might be duplex or semiduplex depending on protocol
	- minimal necessary elements of scheme:
		clock
		TX line, RX line (for both: data register (store sending data) + shift register (send bit by bit))
		GND + E

  USB (universal serial bus) = https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB
	- differ by
		protocol versions (..., 2.0, 3.0, ...)
		connector types (A, ..., B, ..., C)
	- master-slave model, master always initiates transaction (even if input from slave is required)
	- connection particularities:
		power supply by USB connection and power management by master
		on-fly detection
		net topology (IP:port logical analogue)
			address = simultaneously connecting of several slaves (7 bit address = up to 127) to one master
			endpoint = several endpoints in one connection
